The used handheld game section at GameStop always seemed underappreciated. I spent a lot of time at the front counter trying to find the cheapest games with the best labels. Game Boy Advance games rarely caught my interest. Purchasing a game without a box when I could spend about ten more dollars to get it sealed at any other store really did not appeal to me. Also, compared to Game Boy Color and original Game Boy games, the artwork on the labels was nowhere near as interesting. 

At this point, Game Boy Color was in an odd spot. It was not retro but games had already stopped being produced for it. I wish I would have known that *Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets*, the last Game Boy Color game released here in the United States, was an RPG, I just assumed it was an inferior version of the PS2 game. The release of Harry Potter games baffled me. I remember watching an episode of X-Play with a review for *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone* being featured even though I had owned the DVD for *Chamber of Secrets* for months. I forget if there was a promotion or if my parents decided to treat me to a game, but I would eventually get a used copy of *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone* on the PS1 from GameStop. It was a bargain and while I would not have used that word back then, it was the reason why I found the handheld section so appealing.
