I tend to just gloss over booths at swap meets that sell clothes. My brother and I were walking past one of those booths that seemed uninteresting. The booth was surrounded by racks of clothes but there was a tarp in the center with some shoes and other random items. I spotted an NES cartridge but I did not think it was worth purchasing. My brother wanted to take a closer look at the game, but he was eating one of those classic swap meet bacon-wrapped hot dogs so he had me crouch down to check it out. 

It was a copy of *Home Alone 2*. My brother must have some memories about those Home Alone games. The Game Boy version of *Home Alone 2* was one of the first games in my collection that was largely started by being given my brother's old games. There is a bin in the garage that contains a box for the first *Home Alone* game on Game Boy, but the cartridge itself is nowhere to be found. The video review for the NES version of *Home Alone* by the Angry Video Game Nerd has steered me away from wanting to find that game.

I should have stayed away from this cartridge. I nearly dropped it. I was kneeling, trying to keep my balance and then, I was no longer kneeling. I fell from kneeling distance. It was so short of a fall that it probably looked like I was just having trouble getting up from the ground. I put the cartridge back and stood up. We did not buy the copy of *Home Alone 2* on NES.
