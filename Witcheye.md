I like when game titles get straight to the point. In *Witcheye*, you play as a witch that takes the form of an eyeball as she retrieves stolen gems. Short, side-scrolling levels keep the game feeling fresh even if the basic formula remains the same. *Witcheye* is a game with a lot of replay value that you may already own if you aimlessly claim the free games on Prime Gaming.

The menus in *Witcheye* are a dead giveaway that this was originally a mobile game, but the controls translate nicely. On mobile, movement is performed by swiping. To get around not having a touch screen, swipe controls have been moved entirely to the left analogue stick. This sounds pretty standard, but the addition of a dedicated button used to stop movement is the first indicator that *Witcheye* is not your traditional platformer.

*Witcheye* is a side-scroller where you never touch the ground. You also do not have the ability to jump as you are always floating. Flicking the analogue stick will fling your character in that direction. Momentum is crucial in knocking out enemies and breaking blocks. You can gain speed by repeatedly pressing the analogue stick in the same direction and zoom through levels. Mouse controls are also available which mimic swiping. You are going to need a large mousepad with the amount of swiping you will need to do in later levels. The physics take a few levels to get used to, but moving your way through the environment is more intuitive than it sounds. The range of control that this game offers makes *Witcheye* look like a shoot-em-up without bullets. 

Levels in *Witcheye* are short but plentiful.
