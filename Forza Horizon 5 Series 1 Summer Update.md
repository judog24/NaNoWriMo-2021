The first week of *Forza Horizon 5* was a nice time to get introduced to the game. There were still weekly and daily challenges, but none of the progress during the launch period seems to be logged in the game. With the start of Series 1, progress is now recorded to your profile to provide easy proof of completion for bragging rights. The game follows the same structure as *Forza Horizon 4* where a series will take players through all four seaons which will each last a week. Since I was still in the early stages of the game when the season started last Thursday, I found that the biggest challenge was simply acquiring the correct cars to complete the seaosnal events. The nice thing about getting new cars to complete challenges is that it means I spend time actually driving the cars instead of having them stack up in my garage.

Over the weekend, I spent a solid hour in the Auction House trying to snipe the cheapest cars I could find. One thing that stood out to me was the amount of Toyota Supras and Willys Jeeps for sale. I purchased a few that had interesting designs with the standout being a Barbie inspired Jeep. From a cost perspective, these cars were not valuable but they were sought after due to an oversight in car mastery unlocks. This oversight was fixed in a patch that dropped today. The upgrade path to earn a Super Wheelspin was absurdly short for such an inexpensive vehicle. Players were just grinding out skill points and purchasing these vehicles from the Autoshow to get a nearly unlimited supply of Super Wheelspins. Once a car mastery skill is applied it will remain on the car even when it is transferred to another owner which means that the Jeeps listed in the Auction House are worthless. The Auction House economy is not something that I dived deep into in *Forza Horizon 4* but it sounds like it can scratch that itch and be a chepaer alternative to late-night eBay hunting.

The latest patch supposedly also brings improvements to Horizon Arcade to make them more accessible, but I have not noticed any changes. I played for a few hours today after installing the update on both Xbox One and PC and still had trouble getting another player to join an event with me. It is not fun to drive out of my way for these events and accomplish nothing especially when there is so much to do in the game. I wish that Horizon Arcade events would have an alert that pops up at the top of the screen like Forzathon Live events in *Forza Horizon 4*. Although those events could be just as empty at times, it seemed like there was a higher chance of completing them because they were difficult to ignore. I am just going to assume that I will not be able to complete the challenge for successfully finishing a Horizon Arcade event.

I will also not complete The Trial event this week. I still need to enter the Hall of Fame. At the rate things have been going, I will probably enter it by playing the bare minimum of offline events. During my initial impressions of the game, I liked how the game gave you a choice of how you wanted to progress. Story progression just seems to be getting in the way for me. I am earning so many accolade points by completing seasonal events that I currently have seven story unlocks at my disposal. Each time I reach enough points for an unlock, the game alerts me by bringing up the menu to decide where I want to go next. I just exit out of it and continue driving. My only motivation for making progress through the story is just to be eligible to participate in future seasonal events that require being in the Hall of Fame. 

I am looking forward to the next season. With Pokemon releasing on Friday and Halo Infinite multiplayer dropping early, November is turning out to be more busy than I was expecting. I still need to finish *Psychonauts 2*. It is a very exciting time for video games.
