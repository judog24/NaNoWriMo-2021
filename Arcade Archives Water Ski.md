One of my favorite things about arcade games is how they take a simple idea and turn that into an entire game. I have never been water skiing, but I imagine that I would be constantly falling over just like in the 1983 Taito arcade game, *Water Ski*. Judging by Google search results, this seems to be a mostly forgotten title with 1997's *Sega Water Ski* taking the spotlight. In yet another entry in the *Arcade Archives* series, Japanese publisher Hamster brings this game to the Nintendo Switch and Playstation 4 to forever preserve the memory of crashing into rocks. *Arcade Archives Water Ski* offers a simple but fun premise that is undermined by boring methods to dominate high score leaderboards.

Prepare to stare at a lot of blue in *Water Ski*. Like many fast paced vehicle-oriented games of the era, *Water Ski* uses an overhead perspective that allows the game to place an obscene amount of obstacles in the ocean. Why would someone go water skiing in such dangerous conditions? Where are all of these rocks coming from? How is the driver of this boat so confident to go full speed when at any moment he could meet an untimely death? You control a brave water skier just trying to make your through the water without hitting anything face-first.

Simply avoiding obstacles is not enough to succeed at this game. While small rocks can be weaved in between with no issues, large boulders pose a bigger threat as the rope that extends from the back of the boat to the skier's hands can get caught and break off. This can happen more easily than you would think as the boat has a tendency to just verge off in the opposite direction causing the player to zig-zag throughout a level. If things get too overwhelming, there is a dedicated button to slow the boat down. This will grant you finer control over the skier, but if you slow the boat down too much, you will lose your balance and fall in the water anyways. Luckily, the game is somewhat forgiving with falls.

*Water Ski* utilizes a timer instead of a three hit life system. Players will start with two minutes and thirty seconds to travel as far as they can.
