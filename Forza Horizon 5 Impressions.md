My most anticipated game of the year has finally arrived. It is too early to tell if it will beat *Forza Horizon 4* as my favorite Xbox One game that I do not play on Xbox One, but I am having a fantastic time with *Forza Horizon 5*, when it works. The large graphical upgrade had me wondering if my GTX 1070 was going to be able to keep up. *Forza Horizon 4* ran like a dream, even at 2160p. I typically ran that game at 1440p just to make sure there were never any frame rate dips. This was a massive step up from the performance that I was getting from the demos for *Forza Horizon 3* and *Forza Motorsport 7* which ran choppy even on the lowest settings at the lowest resolution I could set them to. My initial attempts at playing *Forza Horizon 5* were ruined by crashes that would cause the game to exit to the desktop after a few minutes. I had to resort to playing on my regular Xbox One. I was blown away by how well the game was running on the console, I cannot wait to see it performs on a Series X when I eventually get my hands on one.

The most notable improvement over *Forza Horizon 4* so far is how quick you are thrown into the open world with other players. I want to say that within fifteen minutes of playing, I was able to see other players driving around. With slightly over an hour of playtime, I was able to access the online features that are such a big draw to this series. This is much shorter than the four hour or so long tutorial that *Forza Horizon 4* made you sit through before getting the freedom to experience the true game. *Forza Horizon 5* still holds your hand, but you have the freedom to just ignore the main story and work on completing those online challenges.

I need to make more progress with the single player content, but I like the changes that were made in progressing your career. Accolades are a group of over one thousand challenges that allow campaign progression regardless of how you choose to play the game. Complete enough challenges and you can unlock new events in different parts of the map. Another improvement is being able to choose the type of events you want to unlock. This means you can focus on just road racing or dirt racing. I have a feeling you will eventually have to play every type of event, but it is nice to choose which style of racing I want to tackle first.

I am just barely scratching the surface with *Forza Horizon 5* but there is an overwhelming amount of content. It feels like something is always being accomplished. I know I am going to be spending a bunch of time with this game trying to collect the rare cars being offered weekly. The first season officially starts in about a day. The structure of online challenges is very similar to *Forza Horizon 4*. 

The biggest difference is that Forzathon Live events which took place every hour at the top of the hour have been replaced with Horizon Arcade events. Multiple arcade events that suit different playstyles will spawn on the map instead. So far I have stumbled across drift events and wreckage events where you make progress by running into things. I have not had good luck in managing to complete these events. I cannot tell if I am just unlucky or if the servers are causing issues, but I am lucky to even get one person to participate in these events with me. The requirements to complete them pretty much require at least four people to join. I hope I do not have to resort to finding groups on Discord to get a caravan together to knock these challenges out.

Online multiplayer has been improved. Races are now determined by individual results instead of a team ranking. This will probably mean that I am going to rarely win, but this prevent the issue that *Forza Horizon 4* had where you could place first in every race in a series but still lose if your teammates could not keep up. I will have to explore if this is an option, but I wish there was a way to setup matchmaking for a single race instead of a series of races as it does take a while to complete them once you take into account all of the loading times you face.

Loading times in single player events may just be an issue on the original Xbox One. When I was attempting to make my way through the introduction on PC transitions between racing and cutscenes were smooth. On Xbox One, it was awkward reaching the end of a section and then getting a black loading screen before getting a cutscene that is supposed to look like a seamless transition. I have heard this is not an issue on the Series X.

I was able to get the PC version working by temporarily stopping my antivirus software. I hope there is a patch that allows the game to be played without any tricks. Running as administrator did not do anything to solve the issue. The thing that surprised me about the crashes is that they never occurred while driving, it was always during some sort of transition whether it was entering a cutscene or trying to run a benchmark. The good news is that the game runs on a GTX 1070. I am going to have to spend some time tweaking the settings to achieve the best graphical fidelity while maintaining a steady sixty frames per second.

Time just flies by playing *Forza Horizon 5*. It does everything in its power to get you to keep playing. I cannot wait to put more time into this game. If I had to take a guess, this will probably end up being my game of the year.
