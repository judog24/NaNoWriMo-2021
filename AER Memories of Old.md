*AER: Memories of Old* is a bite sized open-world adventure game that is hampered down by keeping things too safe. 

Double-tapping the jump button in the overworld will transform the main character from a human to a bird, sending the player into a flight mode. Soaring through the world is a joy. There are no meters or timers to worry about. You can fly as far and as long as you wish. As soon as you exit the game's introductory dungeon, this feature is available, meaning that you are free to explore the entire map without any obstructions. The map, while small and mostly empty, does have some variety in its landscapes with areas having entirely different weather conditions.

Exploring the game's open world is underwhelming. Looking at the game's achievements list on other platforms will suggest that there are Easter eggs to find. Playing on the Nintendo Switch, I really did not feel motivated to stop and look around the overworld. The overworld is designed to utilize the flight mechanics as most of the game's map is split apart in what can best be described as floating islands. Some of these islands are questionably small and remind me of the wacky planet designs of *Super Mario Galaxy*. Unlike *Super Mario Galaxy* where there seems to be a collectible packed into every corner, there is nothing to be on the lookout for in *AER: Memories of Old*.

There are no collectibles. There are no powerups. Weapons are out of the question as there are no enemies to encounter. Lore about the world can occasionally be found, but a good chunk of the lore is placed in the game's three dungeons and is difficult to miss. NPCs are few and far between. At the start of the game, the player is introduced to a group of NPCs that give vague instructions on where to go. Travelling back to to this town later in the game will provide different scenes of dialogue, but I never found myself getting attached to these characters. Backtracking to this area is most likely not necessary as the game's three main dungeons can be tackled in any order.
